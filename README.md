## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pavel (nickname: Mr_La1m). I also like the color greenâ€”hence the nickname "La1m" (lime)!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Globaltest LLC and preparing my PhD thesis in "Informatics and Computer Engineering."

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and Python.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to machine learning and computer vision.
